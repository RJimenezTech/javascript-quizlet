# Javascript Quizlet

## Description 

This project is an interactive quiz app for studying JavaScript concepts. To help a student become familiar with coding assessments and give them a chance to test their skills, this application invites you to try a quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.
